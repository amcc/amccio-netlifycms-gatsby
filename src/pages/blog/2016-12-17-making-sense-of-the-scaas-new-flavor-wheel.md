Gatsby was combined with WordPress as a backend to create a degree show website for Graphic Media Design at LCC. Students worked collaboratively with me to help design and code the website.

## technology

Wordpress\
The familiarity of WordPress, its ease of use and customisability, and the ability to have strict user/role control to enable hundreds of students to individually have control over their own (and only their own) projects made it a great choice as a backend

Gatsby\
Gatsby is very fast and very efficient. The degree show required a very fast website that could withstand high hit rates. The show used the website in a kiosk environment on multiple screens within the show, the site needed to behave like an app in that environment. Gatsby prefetches pages and loads new pages almost instantly, something that previous incarnations of the site on WordPress as a front end struggled with even with efficient caching.

## design

The site was to be as simple as possible, allowing the students work to shine. It was designed to align closely with the print and show design, a litho print publication used a monotone orange on images which was reflected in a SVG preload on images throughout the site using the Sharp plugin.
