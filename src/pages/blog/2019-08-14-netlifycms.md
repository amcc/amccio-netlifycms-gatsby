  This website is created with NetlifyCMS and Gatsby. NetlifyCMS is particularly
  exciting as it essentially provides a website that uses a combination of
  GitHub and Netlify as your host and CMS.

There is no php CMS such as WordPress, or Drupal, nor is there any reliance on a third party like Contentful. This fixes a lot of future maintenance issues.

Gatsby is great, but if you're not a developer you probably don't want to edit a bunch of markdown files to create your website, clients want a CMS, something online they can edit their files with. I am currently maintaining Drupal and WordPress backends for Gatsby websites, there are distinct advantages to these systems depending on your needs. But for this site NetlifyCMS fit the bill well. I no longer have to maintain another server or worry about PHP security.
