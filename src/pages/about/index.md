amcc.io is Alistair McClymont, an artist and coder from the UK. Retheme

### Full stack developer and designer
My experience stems from both art/design and development. I began coding in 1995, creating websites and interactive media. Alongside this I was studying fine art at Hull, the the Royal College of Art. I now work as a full stack developer, a designer, a senior lecturer at University of the Arts London and as an artist.

### Driving forces
My digital work stems from a desire to continue learning, researching and education. I enjoy the conceptual design challenge as much as the techical and programatic. I am passionate about discovering new technolgoy and new methodologies.

### Art and Design work
I teach a variety of subjects around art and design, from core design subjects ranging from video, generative coding design to sculpture and installation art. My own art and design practice see's me exhibit internationally both as a solo artist and in a partnership with Dr. John Fass.

### Code and Development
I began with simple html websites in a summer holiday job at the age of 16 in 1994, looking a the source code and creating sites in notepad. The web has come a long way since then. In the meantime i've worked a lot with large scale CMS sites (many in Drupal and Wordpress), I've worked as a Flash animator and developer. Most of my current efforts are in JavaScript (and occassionaly Python and Java). I'm finding Gatsby/React/Node fun, but love to play with generative code in Processing, P5.js and Paper.js.
